# LojbandTranslator

This assignment involves creating a program that processes statements written in a constructed language inspired by Lojban, focusing on the interpretation and execution of various logical predicates. Lojban is a logical language designed to reduce ambiguity in grammar and syntax, making it an interesting choice for programming language design, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence applications. The assignment's core objective is to build a system that can parse and evaluate Lojban-like statements, handling predefined predicates that perform logical operations or manipulate data. This includes operations such as addition, subtraction, equality checks, and list manipulation, as well as the declaration of new predicates.

The code developed for this assignment comprises several key components, including a parser (tokenize_lojban function) that breaks down Lojban statements into tokens, a logic processor that interprets these tokens to identify predicates and their arguments, and a set of predicate functions that implement the logical operations specified by the tokens. Parsing involves analyzing the structure of the input statements to extract meaningful elements, such as numbers, predicate names, and variables. This process allows the program to understand the intent behind each statement, whether it's performing a mathematical operation, comparing values, or constructing lists. The parser and logic processor work in tandem to translate the syntactically structured input into a form that the program can execute.

Predicates are at the heart of the program's functionality, acting as the building blocks for the operations the language can perform. Each predicate corresponds to a specific operation or logical assertion, such as "sumji" for addition, "vujni" for subtraction, "dunli" for checking equality, "steni" for creating an empty list, and "steko" for constructing cons cells. These predicates, along with others like "fatci" for asserting existence and "cmavo" for declaring new predicates, enable the language to express and evaluate a wide range of logical statements. The predicates' implementation involves parsing their arguments, performing the specified operation, and updating a dictionary of variables to keep track of values and results.

The integration of parsing, processing, and predicate execution allows the program to function as a rudimentary interpreter for the Lojban-inspired language. By analyzing the input statements, identifying the relevant predicates and their arguments, and executing the associated logical operations, the program can evaluate complex expressions and manipulate data according to the rules defined by the predicates. This approach demonstrates the principles of language design and interpretation, showcasing how structured syntax and semantics can be used to convey and execute logical operations.
